# calculator
My first PHP script I've ever written. 

Back in November 2012 (I was 14 years old).

# Important
I know that the input is **NOT** validated. That's because I didn't know about data validation. Because of historical 
reasons, I won't alter the `master` branch to fix those issues. Eventually I'll push a `remastered` branch, which will 
contain fixes and changes and validation and so on. But I don't want to do that.

Don't use this code.
